dummy.py,1,Code Smell,MAJOR,Very Low,"from math import *","Wildcard import 'from math import *' makes code less readable and pollutes the namespace.","Avoid wildcard imports; import only required symbols or use 'import math' and qualify names."
dummy.py,5,Bug,CRITICAL,Very Low,"if a > b:","Undefined variables 'a' and 'b' used in condition; this will raise NameError at runtime.","Define 'a' and 'b' before use or guard with input/arguments; if placeholder, add a clear TODO comment."
dummy.py,7,Code Smell,MINOR,Low,"if a - b > 10:","Deeply nested conditionals increase cyclomatic complexity and reduce readability.","Simplify logic or extract function(s) to flatten nesting."
dummy.py,13,Code Smell,MINOR,Very Low,"else: pass","Redundant 'else: pass' — the else block is unnecessary and can be removed.","Remove the redundant 'else: pass' to improve clarity."
main.py,1,Bug,MAJOR,Low,"import psutil","Importing external dependency 'psutil' at module level without handling ImportError; import will fail in environments where 'psutil' is not installed.","Document 'psutil' in requirements or guard import with try/except and provide a helpful error message or fallback."
main.py,3,Code Smell,MINOR,Very Low,"def get_system_memory_info():","Missing function docstring for 'get_system_memory_info'.","Add a short docstring describing inputs and return values."
main.py,5,Code Smell,MINOR,Very Low,"total_memory = mem.total // (1024 * 1024)  # Convert to MB","Use of magic number 1024*1024 to convert bytes to MB reduces readability.","Define BYTES_PER_MB = 1024 * 1024 and use it for conversion."
main.py,7,Code Smell,MAJOR,Very Low,"print(f\"Total Memory: {total_memory} MB\")","Unreachable code: statement after 'return' is never executed.","Remove the unreachable print or move it before the return if intended."
main.py,10,Code Smell,MAJOR,Very Low,"total_memory, available_memory = get_system_memory_info()","Module-level side-effect: calling function at import time. This executes work during import and may be undesirable for libraries.","Move execution into an 'if __name__ == \"__main__\"' block so importing the module doesn't run code."
main.py,11,Code Smell,MINOR,Very Low,"print(f\"Total Memory: {total_memory} MB\")","Printing to stdout at module import time. Libraries should avoid printing on import.","Use logging module and guard with main block, or remove prints."
main.py,13,Bug,CRITICAL,Very Low,"if a == b:","Undefined variables 'a' and 'b' used in condition; this will raise NameError at runtime.","Define 'a' and 'b' before use or remove/replace this conditional."
